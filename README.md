# Rough: Cover
As [background-size](http://caniuse.com/#feat=background-img-opts) isn't too well supported, this component will make your covers bulletproof in IE7 and IE8 as well.

## Installation

* [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save rough-cover`
* Download: [zip](https://github.com/oskarrough/rough-cover/zipball/master)
* Git: `git clone https://github.com/oskarrough/rough-cover.git`

## Get started

* `<div class="Cover Cover--intrinsic">` - will scale height based on width. Be sure to edit the ratio in the CSS.
* `<div class="Cover Cover--fixed">` - will center image both horizontally and vertically inside the fixed dimensions. Be sure to edit the height in the CSS.
